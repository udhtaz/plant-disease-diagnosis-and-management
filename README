# Crop Disease Diagnosis and Management Web App

## Overview

This Flask web application provides a platform for diagnosing plant diseases based on user-provided symptoms. The system uses diagnostic information of plant disease available on PlantVillage.

## Features

- **Disease Diagnosis:** Users can select the name of a plant and/or the observed symptoms, and the system will provide a diagnosis based on the available plant disease data.

- **Excel Sheet Generation:** The application scrapes plant disease information from PlantVillage URLs, organizes the data into a structured format, and generates an Excel sheet containing disease information for different plants.

- **Generate Knowledge Base in Excel Format:** Knowledge Base Engineer can generate the Excel file containing plant disease information into the expert system.
