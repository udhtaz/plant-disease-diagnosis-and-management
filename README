# Plant Disease Diagnosis Web App

## Overview

This Flask web application provides a platform for diagnosing plant diseases based on user-provided symptoms. The system uses OpenAI's GPT-3 for symptom matching and extracts disease information from plant disease datasets available on PlantVillage.

## Features

- **Disease Diagnosis:** Users can input the name of a plant and the observed symptoms, and the system will provide a diagnosis based on the available plant disease data.

- **Excel Sheet Generation:** The application scrapes plant disease information from PlantVillage URLs, organizes the data into a structured format, and generates an Excel sheet containing disease information for different plants.

- **Download Excel:** Users can download the generated Excel file containing plant disease information.
